# SEO-Keyword-AI-Bot
The Keyword AI bot suggests semantically related keywords using Word2Vec, aiding content creators in expanding topic coverage and enhancing SEO strategies.

This Bot is currently in development and aims to help businesses word their marketing strategies and platforms efficiently. 

Below is a breakdown of the utilities for the SEO-Keyword-AI-Bot: 

-Import Custom Search Data: Users can import their list of keywords (from a text file where each keyword is on a new line). This allows users to work with real search data of their choice.

-Semantic Keyword Expansion: For each keyword in the imported list, the tool will suggest a set of semantically similar keywords. This is done using the Word2Vec model, which understands the contextual relationship between words.

-Keyword Ideas Generation: The tool can be used to generate a list of keyword ideas for content creation, PPC campaigns, or other SEO/SEM activities. By understanding semantically related terms, users can potentially discover new keyword opportunities they hadn't considered.

-Content Strategy Development: By understanding related terms, content creators can ensure they are covering topics comprehensively and are not missing out on relevant sub-topics.

-SEO & SEM: The tool can aid in both organic search optimization (SEO) and paid search campaigns (SEM). By targeting a broader set of related keywords, websites can potentially drive more traffic.

-Customization & Expansion: Since this is a basic first model, the bot can easily have add ons, integrating more features like search volume data, competition metrics, or even sentiment analysis.
