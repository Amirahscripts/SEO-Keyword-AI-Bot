# SEO-Keyword-AI-Bot
This bot can help drive traffic by uncovering semantically related keywords, enabling businesses to target a broader set of search terms and capture a wider audience searching for related topics.

I coded this Bot in Python and is currently in testing. 

Below is a breakdown of the utilities for the SEO-Keyword-AI-Bot: 

-Import Custom Search Data: Users can import their list of keywords (from a text file where each keyword is on a new line). This allows users to work with real search data of their choice.

-Semantic Keyword Expansion: For each keyword in the imported list, the tool will suggest a set of semantically similar keywords. This is done using the Word2Vec model, which understands the contextual relationship between words.

-Keyword Ideas Generation: The tool can be used to generate a list of keyword ideas for content creation, PPC campaigns, or other SEO/SEM activities. By understanding semantically related terms, users can potentially discover new keyword opportunities they hadn't considered.

-Content Strategy Development: By understanding related terms, content creators can ensure they are covering topics comprehensively and are not missing out on relevant sub-topics.

-SEO & SEM: The tool can aid in both organic search optimization (SEO) and paid search campaigns (SEM). By targeting a broader set of related keywords, websites can potentially drive more traffic.

-Customization & Expansion: Since this is a basic first model, the bot can easily have add ons, integrating more features like search volume data, competition metrics, or even sentiment analysis.
